# üìä Survey Response Coder (Pandas + LLM API) for FormSG

A lightweight, production-ready tool to **turn messy free-text survey responses into structured insights**, powered by Pandas and the [AIBOTS Gov](https://uat.aibots.gov.sg) LLM API.

## Problem

Open-ended survey results are very useful (compared to multiple choices that limits surveyee responses) to understand people's concerns, behaviours and experiences. But analysing them is a nightmare:

* **Slow:** thousands of responses can take weeks to manually read and code.
* **Inconsistent:** different analysts apply categories differently, leading to bias.
* **Unscalable:** insights arrive too late to influence fast-moving decisions.
  
## Solution

**Survey Response Coder** automates this process end-to-end:

* ü§ñ **AI-powered categorisation** ‚Äî Uses AIBOTS Gov‚Äôs LLM to classify responses with high accuracy.
* ‚ö° **Batch processing** ‚Äî Analyse responses 10√ó faster by coding rows in configurable chunks.
* üìù **Smart output** ‚Äî Adds a `[Codes]` column directly beside each question for easy tracking.
* üîÑ **Continuous autosave** ‚Äî Resume safely even if the process stops mid-run.
* üóÇÔ∏è **Reusable workflows** ‚Äî Configurable `questions_config.json` lets you plug in new surveys instantly.
* üìä **One-line summariser** ‚Äî Run a simple script afterwards to generate each category‚Äôs frequency and percentage of respondents.

**Outcome:** What once took **hours or days of manual coding** now takes **minutes**, producing **consistent, human-interpretable categories** ready for analysis.

## Pre-requisites

Before running the tool, prepare these:

1. **Eligibility**

   * You must be a **Singapore Government employee** with a valid **WOG email address** to obtain an AIBOTS Gov API key.
   * This tool will not work without proper access.

2. **Survey data file**

   * A CSV or Excel file containing your survey responses.
   * Each **open-ended question** must be in its own column (header).
   * Closed-ended or demographic questions can remain in the file ‚Äî the tool only processes the columns you configure.

3. **API key**

   * Obtain an API key from [AIBOTS Gov](https://uat.aibots.gov.sg).
   * Export it into your environment:

     ```powershell
     $env:AIBOTS_API_KEY = "your-real-key-here"
     ```

     Or save it in a `.env` file:

     ```
     AIBOTS_API_KEY=your-real-key-here
     ```

4. **Categorisation instructions**

   * For each **survey question (column header)** you want to process, write **one instruction** that tells the LLM how to categorise all answers in that column.
   * Example:

     * *‚ÄúCategorise into Phishing, Malware, Identity Theft. Use 1‚Äì3 labels max.‚Äù*
     * *‚ÄúCategorise into Privacy Protection, Scam Awareness, or NIL if no answer.‚Äù*

5. **Batch size preference**

   * Choose how many responses to process at once.
   * Default = `1` (safe but slower). Example: `--batch-size 10` for 10 rows per API call.

## ‚ö° Usage

### 1. Configure your questions

Create a `questions_config.json` file describing **which columns to code** and **how to categorise them**.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "question_col": "What worries you most when you use your mobile devices or the internet?",
    "instruction": "Categorise answers into Phishing, Scam Awareness, Malware, or NIL if no answer."
  },
  {
    "question_col": "How do you try to stay safe online?",
    "instruction": "Categorise answers into Privacy Protection, Scam Prevention, Strong Passwords, or NIL."
  }
]
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

* `question_col` must **exactly match** the column header in your survey file.
* `instruction` applies to **all answers in that column**, not per row.

### 2. Run the script

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
To allow the script to save progress (persistent writes to the `[Codes]` columns), your `--input` and `--output` must point to the **same file**.

**Best practice:**

* Keep an untouched copy of your original survey (e.g., `Book1_original.csv`).
* Create a working copy (e.g., `Book1.csv`) and run the tool on that file.

Refer to [üì• Input CSV format](#-input-csv-format) to understand the structure of your survey file.

**Single row at a time (default):**

```bash
python main.py --input Book1.csv --output Book1.csv --config questions_config.json
```

**Batch mode (faster):**

```bash
python main.py --input Book1.csv --output Book1.csv --config questions_config.json --batch-size 10
```

**Quiet mode (no row-by-row logs):**

```bash
python main.py --input Book1.csv --output Book1.csv --config questions_config.json --batch-size 10 --no-verbose
```

## üì• Input CSV format

Your survey file should be a **CSV (or Excel)** with each **open-ended question as a column header**, and each row as a respondent‚Äôs answer.

Example (`Book1.csv`):

| What does 'digital safety' mean to you? How do you protect yourself or stay safe in online spaces? | What digital threats are you most concerned about when going online? | What challenges do you face when trying to stay safe online or protecting yourself from digital threats? |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not giving out personal info                                                                       | Phishing emails                                                      | Hard to tell if websites are real                                                                        |
| Using strong passwords                                                                             | Malware, viruses                                                     | Too many scam messages                                                                                   |
| Being careful of links                                                                             | Identity theft                                                       | Don‚Äôt know enough about online safety                                                                    |

## üì§ Output CSV format

After running the tool, a new `[Codes]` column will appear immediately **to the right of each question** with the categorisation labels from the LLM:

| What does 'digital safety' mean to you? How do you protect yourself or stay safe in online spaces? | What does 'digital safety'... \[Codes] | What digital threats are you most concerned about when going online? | What digital threats... \[Codes] |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Not giving out personal info                                                                       | Privacy Protection                     | Phishing emails                                                      | Phishing                         |
| Using strong passwords                                                                             | Password Management                    | Malware, viruses                                                     | Malware                          |
| Being careful of links                                                                             | Scam Awareness                         | Identity theft                                                       | Identity Theft                   |


## ‚úÖ Features

* Automates open-ended survey coding
* Config-driven (`questions_config.json`)
* Batch mode for speed
* Safe autosaving (persistent progress with same input/output file)
* Works with CSV/Excel

## üóÇÔ∏è Categories Cache (`categories_cache.json`)

When you run the tool, it automatically maintains a **categories cache** in a file called `categories_cache.json`.

### üîπ What it does

* Stores the list of categories discovered for each survey question (column).
* Ensures new categories added in one run are remembered in future runs.
* Prevents the model from ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù previously assigned labels when you stop and restart the script.

### üîπ How it works

* Each survey question (by column name) gets its own entry in the cache.
* After each pass, newly discovered categories are merged into the cache.
* The cache is reloaded every time you restart, so you can safely resume coding without losing progress.

### üîπ Example

`categories_cache.json`:

```json
{
  "What digital threats are you most concerned about when going online?": [
    "Phishing",
    "Malware",
    "Identity Theft"
  ],
  "How do you try to stay safe online?": [
    "Password Management",
    "Two-Factor Authentication",
    "Privacy Protection"
  ]
}
```

### üîπ Tips

* **Keep this file** between runs to preserve category memory.
* If you want to **start fresh** (ignore all old categories), simply delete `categories_cache.json`.
* You can also open it to quickly inspect what categories the model has generated so far.

## üìä Summarising Results

Once your survey responses have been coded, you can quickly analyse the results with the included summariser script.

### üîπ What it does

* Detects all `[Codes]` columns in your coded CSV/Excel file.
* Cleans duplicates and normalises label variants (e.g., *‚ÄúPhishing Prevention‚Äù*, *‚ÄúScam Prevention‚Äù* ‚Üí **Phishing/Scam Prevention**).
* Counts how many times each category appears.
* Shows percentages relative to the total number of survey respondents.
* Optionally exports a combined summary CSV.

### üîπ Run it

From your project root:

```bash
python scripts/summarise_codes.py --input Book1.csv --save-csv coded_summary.csv
```

### üîπ Example Output

```

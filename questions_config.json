    "instruction": "Task: assign category labels to the answer. Return at most 2 labels as 'Label1; Label2' with no extra text.\nMECE guardrails:\n1) Assign a label only if the wording clearly supports it (≈70% semantic match). Do NOT force-fit.\n2) Labels must be DISTINCT (no overlaps/synonyms). If two candidates overlap, keep the one that best captures the user's intent and DROP the other.\n3) If nothing fits well, output 'NEW:<concise label>' (1–3 words). For blank/none, output 'NIL'.\n4) Tie-break hierarchy when overlap exists: Action/Protection > Awareness/General > Vague. Use at most 1 secondary label and only if it adds non-overlapping meaning.\nCanonical labels for this question (use these exact strings): Privacy Protection; Scam/Phishing Protection; Transaction Safety; Safe Browsing; Password Management; Two-Factor Authentication.\nDefinitions (to avoid overlap):\n- Privacy Protection: keeping personal data private, control of sharing/PII.\n- Scam/Phishing Protection: recognising and actively avoiding scam/phishing attempts (vigilance, not clicking, verifying, reporting, using tools like ScamShield).\n- Transaction Safety: safe online payments, verifying merchants, chargeback safety.\n- Safe Browsing: cautious link/site use, avoiding risky websites.\n- Password Management: strong/unique passwords, password manager use.\n- Two-Factor Authentication: OTP/authenticator apps, 2FA setup.\nFormat: 'Label' or 'Label1; Label2' or 'NEW:<label>' or 'NIL'."
